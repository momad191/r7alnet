                     SRF addresses the absence of dedicated Sudanese platforms focusing on capacity building, knowledge sharing and research dissemination in a blended continuous education model. In this context we provide a common platform for interaction between Sudanese learners and researchers to establish and drive the momentum of research and education in Sudan. SRF serves as a bridge to link Sudanese undergraduates & postgraduates with the expertise and competence of Sudanese researchers worldwide.
